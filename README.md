# Ubuntu_deb
essential software for thr Ubuntu ststem（basic daily use）.

Presumably,you already know whether you are able to use the system and there are no requirements for specific software.

First,you will sudo apt update | sudo apt upgrade.
than you can install software 
If you are a programmer or a programmer enthusiast you can install VScode（Visual Studio Code）, IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm... if you are a programmer enthusiast,I think VScode is completely enough.
If you are a designer or rendering novice you can install GIMP, Shotcut, Blender... 
If you watch videos, read novels or use in daily life, you can install YouTube, DouYin...（programs with the .desktop suffix）
If you are a "all-rounder" you can install all of them.
If you play game, then I'm so sorry .This system is not suitable for you. But Minecrraft, csgo2 can paly

I have already put thr most basic ones on thr cloud disk: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1sSZTO9JRE0pyqUsudICzzA?pwd=xopm
